TODO:
Make the job show


STEPS:
1, Fetch a company from backend.
2, Put it in the state.

Need to fix this problem: after signup, and maybe login, it doesn't redirect. For this, first finish log out. As I can't log out now.

I should display the position.
Little step:

Why do we need to do selectCompany?

Practice:
How to add a link?
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
<Link to={'/jobs/' + job.id}>{job.position}</Link>

<Route exact path="/jobs/:jobId" component={JobShowContainer} />
