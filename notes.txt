TODO:
1, The button should send a request to the backend.
2, It should create an application to the job.
3, What should it show on the frontend?
4, User should be able to view his applications.
5, Employers should be able to move forward with the application.
6, Applications should be separated in to stages.

Need to visualize things.
1, Click.
  First try using mapDispatchToProps
  Get a function like creatApplication and link it to the view.
2, Send.
3, Backend creates a application.

How to represent which stage it is at?
I should stop thinking about this question for now. There are actually many ways to do. Don't waste time on it now.

Need to fix this problem: after signup, and maybe login, it doesn't redirect. For this, first finish log out. As I can't log out now.

I should display the position.
Little step:

Why do we need to do selectCompany?

Practice:
How to add a link?
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
<Link to={'/jobs/' + job.id}>{job.position}</Link>

<Route exact path="/jobs/:jobId" component={JobShowContainer} />
